# Matcher: Insurance (c12-insurance)
# Trust grade: one-sided (present:True with verbatim spans, or NoMatch — never False)
# Induction set: 6 accepted positives, 0 accepted negatives
# Brief: overseer_brief_v1, 3 July 2026
#
# Patterns induced: the six accepted extractions all state that a named party
# (or "each Party" / "Both Parties") is *obligated* to carry insurance for the
# counterparty's benefit. Two surface grammars recur:
#   (1) "<Party> shall (obtain and) maintain / provide (and maintain) / keep
#        in force ... insurance ..." — an affirmative covenant, sometimes with
#        a long intervening qualifier ("at all times during the currency of
#        this Agreement and for a period of ...") before the verb, or with the
#        object list separated by semicolons rather than periods (Regan's
#        5-line schedule of minimum coverages).
#   (2) "<Party> warrants that it carries ... insurance ..." — a warranty of
#        already-held coverage (Legacy/Sierra-Envision), which the extraction
#        brief explicitly treats as an Insurance requirement.
# The matcher looks for "shall" followed within ~300 characters (no
# intervening "shall", to keep each candidate local) by one of the verbs
# obtain / procure / maintain / provide / keep in force, or for the fixed
# phrase "warrants that it carries", then confirms the word "insurance"
# appears in the same sentence (no period between the verb and "insurance",
# checked in whichever direction — forward for the active-voice cases above,
# backward for passive constructions such as "insurance ... shall be
# maintained"). Candidates containing "not" in the shall-to-verb span are
# dropped (guards against "shall not be required to maintain insurance" and
# similar disclaimers). The returned span is the verb clause expanded to its
# enclosing sentence(s) using nearby ". "/": "/"; " boundaries.
#
# Known limits (published honestly): the matcher only fires on the "shall
# <verb> ... insurance" / "warrants that it carries ... insurance" grammars.
# It will miss requirements phrased with other verbs (e.g. FuseMedical's
# supplementary "The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current
# insurance certificate.", which uses "add" — not in the verb list — so that
# sentence is not separately captured, though the contract's primary
# requirement sentence is). It will also miss a bare heading ("Insurance")
# with no shall/warrants covenant nearby, and any requirement drafted without
# "shall" (e.g. "will maintain", "agrees to procure") since only "shall" and
# "warrants that it carries" are treated as anchors. It deliberately does not
# fire on casual mentions — insurance as a business/industry noun, insurance
# named merely as a shipping/cost item ("packaging, insurance and carriage"),
# or insurance mentioned only as part of an unrelated indemnity/HR clause
# ("employment insurance premiums") — because those lack a "shall <verb>"
# or "warrants that it carries" anchor in the same sentence as the word
# "insurance". Because TRUST is one-sided, any contract that does not fit
# these two grammars raises NoMatch rather than asserting absence.
