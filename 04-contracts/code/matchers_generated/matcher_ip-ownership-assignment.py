CATEGORY: IP Ownership Assignment (yes/no)
TRUST: one-sided (present:True confident hits only; everything else -> NoMatch)
INDUCTION SET: 9 accepted positives (see PROVENANCE below); 0 negatives supplied
BRIEF: overseer_brief_v1, 3 July 2026
DATE INDUCED: 3 July 2026

WHAT THIS MATCHER LOOKS FOR, IN PLAIN LANGUAGE.

The category asks whether IP created by one party becomes the property of the
counterparty, per the contract's terms or upon a triggering event (creation,
delivery, payment). Across the 9 accepted positives the operative language is
genuinely bespoke -- this category sat at the bottom of the published
difficulty figure for a reason -- but five recurring skeletons cover all nine:

  (A) an ASSIGNMENT verb (assign/assigns/assigned/transfer and assign/hereby
      assigns/grant and assign, etc.) governing an IP-shaped object (rights,
      right/title/interest, ownership, "Assigned IP", "Transferred Assets",
      "Developments", copyright, etc.) running "to" a named party -- e.g.
      Armstrong ("Arizona ... hereby assigns its entire right, title and
      interest ... to the Company"), Corio ("hereby assigns all rights in
      and to such Developments to Corio"), Igene ("sufficient to transfer
      Igene's right, title and interest in the Transferred Assets to the
      Operating Company"), Theravance ("hereby assigns all right, title and
      interest in the Company IP to the Company"), Pelican ("hereby assigns
      and transfers to Client all copyright and other intellectual property
      ownership in the Works"), Gpaq ("hereby granted and assigned to
      PFHOF").
  (B) a PROPERTY-OF clause naming a specific party as owner of created work
      -- "sole and absolute/exclusive property of X", "shall be [and
      remain] the property of X" -- e.g. Coral Gold ("will be the sole and
      absolute property of the Company"), EcoScience ("shall be and remain
      the property of ESSI"), Pelican ("shall be the sole and exclusive
      property of the Client").
  (C) an automatic VESTING clause -- "shall automatically ... vest in the
      Company" -- e.g. Theravance.
  (D) an OWN-AND-CONTROL clause -- "shall own and control all right,
      title, interest[,] and copyright in and to" -- e.g. Gpaq.
  (E) a bespoke EXCLUSIVE-RIGHTS-ARISING-FROM-OR-CREATED-BY clause -- e.g.
      Senmiao ("has exclusive rights and interests in all rights,
      ownership, titles, interests and intellectual property rights
      arising from or created by the performance of this Agreement").

KNOWN LIMITS (published honestly, per brief).
  - This is five narrow templates, not a semantic understanding of
    "ownership transfer". Any positive phrased differently -- e.g. pure
    "sole and exclusive owner" without "property of"/"assign"/"vest", or an
    ownership transfer buried in a defined-term cross-reference with no
    local anchor phrase -- will raise NoMatch, i.e. a false negative (silent
    under one-sided trust, which is the safe failure direction here).
  - Pattern (A) explicitly excludes clauses containing "retain" nearby,
    because two of the nine induction contracts (Corio, Pelican) contain a
    same-document decoy where the OTHER party retains/keeps ownership
    ("Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest ...",
    "Developer shall retain full ownership over its Developer Technology")
    a few sentences from the true assignment clause. This exclusion is a
    blunt instrument: a genuine assignment sentence that happens to mention
    "retain" for an unrelated carve-out elsewhere in the same window would
    also be suppressed (false negative, safe direction).
  - Pattern (A) also excludes "assign(s/ed) ... this Agreement", "shall
    not/may not assign", and "non-assignable"/"not assignable" -- these are
    ordinary anti-assignment-of-the-contract boilerplate (present in 3 of
    the 9 induction contracts) and share the verb "assign" but say nothing
    about IP ownership. A contract that assigns IP using only the bare verb
    "assign" pointed at an object this filter doesn't recognise as
    IP-shaped will be missed.
  - Pattern (B) excludes generic role-holders ("the Disclosing Party",
    "the Receiving Party", "either/each/such/the other Party") after "of",
    because Pelican's own contract contains a mutual, symmetric decoy
    ("Confidential Information ... remain the property of the Disclosing
    Party") that is not a one-directional IP assignment. A real positive
    phrased as "property of the Receiving Party" (unusual, but possible)
    would be missed by this exclusion.
  - None of the five patterns attempt to distinguish "IP created under this
    agreement" from "IP already owned pre-existing" -- they trust the local
    anchor phrase. A contract that assigns pre-existing (not newly created)
    IP would still match; that is arguably still an ownership assignment
    per the category definition, so this is treated as in-scope, not a
    limitation.
  - Not evaluated against true negatives: this commission's induction set
    supplied 0 accepted negatives, so precision against genuine "each party
    retains its own IP" contracts rests only on the decoys that happen to
    co-occur in these 9 positive contracts, not on a held-out negative set.
  - Standard library only, no semantic parsing: everything is regex over
    raw text with generous whitespace tolerance (contract text in this
    corpus frequently hard-wraps mid-sentence with runs of spaces).

Expected coverage: reproduces all 9 induction positives. Real-world recall
on the wider corpus is unknown and likely well under 100% given how bespoke
this category's language is -- narrowness was chosen deliberately over
breadth, per the brief's guidance for this category.
