Category: Audit Rights
Trust grade: one-sided (present:True with spans, or NoMatch — never present:False)
Induction set size: 9 accepted positives, 0 accepted negatives
Date: 3 July 2026
Brief: overseer_brief_v1
Commission: c11-audit-rights

Plain-language description of induced patterns and known limits
-----------------------------------------------------------------
All 9 induction contracts grant one party a contractual right to inspect,
audit, or review the counterparty's books, records, files, premises, or
submitted materials in order to verify compliance with the agreement (or
verify payment amounts). Across the 9 examples the invariant is a rights-
granting verb phrase ("shall have the right to", "is entitled to", "may",
"will permit ... to enter") bound tightly (within a short word window) to
an audit/inspect/review/examine verb AND a compliance-relevant object noun
(books and records, premises, files, submitted information/materials,
qualification certificates/business license, or an explicit "Audit Rights"
/ "Records and Audit Rights" section heading). Ten narrow, hand-anchored
patterns were induced, one or two per induction contract, each modelled
directly on the actual clause language found (not on imagined boilerplate).
Two guard rails were added because the induction contracts themselves
contain the category's classic false friends sitting right next to the
true positives: (1) a blacklist window check that suppresses a hit if
"financial statements", "GAAP", "generally accepted accounting
principles", "neutral auditor", "arbitrat*", "beta", "specifications", or
"manifest" appears near the match (this is exactly the trap the brief
warns about: audited-financial-statement / external-auditor mentions,
and the IGENEBIOTECHNOLOGY contract's own "Neutral Auditor" tax-dispute
clause sitting a few hundred lines from its real audit-rights clause,
confirms the trap is real even within the accepted set); (2) a negation
guard that suppresses a hit if "not/no/never/except/unless" appears in the
~60 characters immediately before the matched verb phrase (so "shall NOT
have the right to audit" or "no right to inspect" cannot be mistaken for a
grant of the right).

Known limits (false negatives expected, by design): this matcher only
fires on the specific verb+object phrasings actually observed in the
induction set (plus the immediately adjacent "right to audit ... books and
records ... confirm/compliance" variant, since "right to" and "entitled
to" are attested as interchangeable across the set). Any audit-rights
clause phrased materially differently — e.g. "Licensor may commission a
review of Licensee's accounts", passive constructions, or audit rights
described only by cross-reference to a separate exhibit — will raise
NoMatch rather than guess. Because this is a one-sided commission, that is
the intended and safe failure mode: a missed positive costs nothing here,
a wrong positive would be repeated silently on every contract that reuses
this matcher. Government/regulatory inspection rights (a state authority
inspecting a party, not one contract party auditing the other) and
product/service acceptance-testing "inspection" clauses are deliberately
not matched — both appear in this very induction set as non-matches
sitting next to the real clauses (IDREAMSKYTECHNOLOGY's "supervision and
inspection of relevant competent authority", and StampscomInc's beta
Manifest inspection/acceptance clause) and were verified NOT to fire.
