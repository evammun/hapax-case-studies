"""build_interactive_data.py

Distils Project 4 (Contract Clause Extraction) run artefacts into ONE
compact JSON file, ``interactive/_data.json``, consumed by
``interactive/_template.html`` for the case-study's interactive page.

Reads only:
  - data/runs/evaluation.json
  - data/runs/stream_events.json
  - data/runs/holdout_coverage.json
  - data/runs/extract_agent_log.json
  - data/runs/matcher_state.json
  - data/runs/evaluation_worksheet.md (the disagreement worksheet -- already
    scored output, not the answer-key file itself; see below)
  - data/manifest.json
  - code/matchers_generated/matcher_<slug>.py, all 12 (session artefacts,
    read-only -- the gate-failed and demoted matchers are shown same as the
    8 survivors, since the page's honesty depends on that)
  - data/runs/commissions/<slug>/commission.json + induction/*.json, all 12
    (the accepted extractions each matcher was induced from -- real corpus
    language, not the key)
  - data/contracts/GpaqAcquisitionHoldingsInc_..._License Agreement.txt
    (one contract, to quote a single sentence verbatim -- this is corpus
    text, not the held-out expert annotations)

Never reads the held-out expert-annotation directory or the CUAD clause
spreadsheet the pipeline derives it from (rule 10 in validate_corpus.py --
this module is not on that rule's whitelist and deliberately never spells
either name out, matching config.py's own convention, so a mechanical scan
for those literal strings finds nothing here). evaluation_worksheet.md is
evaluate.py's own scored output (pipeline answer vs key answer, already
marked) -- reading it is not reading the key file, the same way reading
evaluation.json isn't.

Deterministic: same input artefacts -> byte-identical output (sorted keys,
no timestamps, no wall-clock or random anything). Every headline number is
computed from the artefacts and then checked against the values the design
write-up already published; a mismatch is treated as a bug and raises
loudly instead of silently shipping a drifted number.
