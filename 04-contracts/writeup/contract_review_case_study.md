# What fifty real contracts taught a pattern matcher, and what they didn’t

*Every contract here is real, filed with the SEC and annotated by law students and attorneys under The Atticus Project, released under CC BY 4.0. The answer key is theirs, not ours. It stayed out of the pipeline throughout and was read exactly once, after our predictions were already committed to paper.*

## The problem

A legal-operations or due-diligence team facing a stack of contracts asks the same handful of questions of nearly all of them – who signed, when, whose courts, can it be assigned, is liability capped, is competition restricted. Answering these well is the ordinary, expensive work of contract review, and most of it repeats from one contract to the next.

We tested twelve such questions across fifty real commercial contracts. A model read each one and answered all twelve; an overseer watched which questions kept getting answered off the same handful of phrasings and tried to write ordinary code to take over. What is new here is that none of it is invented. The corpus is CUAD – 510 real contracts from SEC filings, annotated under The Atticus Project. We selected 50 for the model to read and 100 more it never saw, held out for the matchers alone, and marked everything against CUAD’s own attorney-reviewed answers – pre-registering our predictions for all twelve categories before running anything, misses left in.

## What happened, in numbers

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Corpus | 510 real CUAD contracts; 50 read by the model, 100 held out (matchers only) |
| Categories tested | 12, spanning near-universal boilerplate to bespoke negotiated language |
| Predictions vs actual | 4 of 12 correct, pre-registered before the run, misses in both directions |
| Matchers reaching the holdout | 8 of 12 (1 killed at the gate, 3 demoted mid-stream) |
| Holdout presence accuracy, matcher-only (176 answers) | 173/176, 98.3%, at zero marginal cost |
| Comparisons marked against the key | 776 (600 stream, 176 holdout) |
| Run cost, introductory pricing (central estimate) | ≈ $10.9 (list ≈ $16.4) |
| Counterfactual – the model reading the 100-contract holdout | ≈ $10.4 central; the matchers answered the same 176 categories for nothing |

## How it works

A Claude Sonnet subagent reads each contract once and answers all twelve questions against one schema – presence, the supporting text, and, for five categories, a normalised answer such as a date or jurisdiction. An overseer watches the model’s accepted answers category by category and, once one has enough consistent examples, writes a deterministic matcher – ordinary pattern-matching code, no model at run time. An activation gate checks that the matcher reproduces the model’s own accepted answers before it goes live; afterwards, every contract the model still reads doubles as a shadow check running quietly alongside it, and any disagreement demotes the matcher for good. This is the same mechanism behind the rest of the Hapax Theme 2 trilogy – the ERP cleanup case study learned report formats, the invoice case study learned suppliers, and here the unit of learning is the category of clause itself.

## What the matchers got wrong

One matcher never reached the holdout. **IP Ownership Assignment** – predicted to stay with the model because IP transfers hide in work-for-hire language rather than a fixed phrase – produced a matcher that failed its own activation gate, a replay false positive against a contract the model had already scored negative. It was frozen before answering a real question. The gate confirmed the prediction; it didn’t just happen to agree with it.

Three more matchers passed the gate, went live, and were demoted later by shadow checks, each for a different reason. **Document Name** fell on a bare schedule issued under a master agreement – the matcher named the schedule, the shadow read named the master, and CUAD’s own key names both, so the trigger was a document the attorneys themselves recorded under two titles. **Parties** fell on a preamble scan that ran past its stopping point into a background section and captured two defined terms as signatories – an ordinary bug, caught live. **Governing Law** fell on a contract naming Texas, Singapore and Belgium law together – its whitelist only knew US states, so it answered “Texas” with confidence where the shadow read called the clause undetermined.

The shadow system is a spot check, not a proof. Of 33 shadow comparisons run during the stream, 30 agreed and 3 produced the demotions above – but the later hand adjudication turned up four further matcher errors on stream contracts the shadows had simply never sampled: a four-party preamble collapsed to two parties (Armstrong), a Document Name overcapture with trailing text (Deltathree), an Agreement Date pulled from a blank joinder form while the real date sat unanchored in the preamble (GWG), and a License Grant anchor that fired on someone else’s licensing terms (IGENE).

Two survivors deserve their own line. **Audit Rights** activated on ten narrow induction patterns and then matched nothing across the 100 held-out contracts – a matcher that passed the exam it wrote for itself and generalised to zero. **Expiration Date** was the category the design singled out in advance as the risk to watch, because its answer is a computed date, not a quoted phrase. It activated anyway, covered 4% of the holdout, and got two of those four answers wrong – a mis-computed date and a false presence. The prediction was scored a miss; its reasoning was vindicated.

## The predictions, and what the key said back

| Category | Predicted | Actual | What happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| Governing Law | A | R | demoted – foreign-jurisdiction blindness |
| Document Name | A | R | demoted – schedule-vs-master ambiguity |
| Agreement Date | A | P | active, 21% holdout coverage |
| Parties | P | R | demoted – preamble scan overran |
| Anti-Assignment | P | P ✓ | 52% coverage, 100% holdout accuracy |
| License Grant | P | P ✓ | 39% coverage, 97.4% holdout accuracy |
| Insurance | P | P ✓ | 19% coverage, 100% holdout accuracy |
| Expiration Date | R | P | activated, wrong on 2 of 4 holdout answers |
| Cap on Liability | R | P | 30% coverage, 100% holdout accuracy |
| Audit Rights | R | P | activated, 0% holdout coverage |
| IP Ownership Assignment | R | R ✓ | the gate confirmed the floor |
| Non-Compete | R | P | 11% coverage, 90.9% holdout accuracy |

Four of twelve, and the misses run both ways. We over-promised the formulaic end – all three categories called fully automatable died, each for a different reason unrelated to volume of examples. We also under-estimated the bespoke end – four categories called model-resident grew matchers that handle a narrow, formulaic minority accurately and correctly decline the rest. The floor we predicted is real; it sits per instance, not per category.

Marked against the key, the matchers answered 88 of 89 stream questions correctly on presence (98.9%) and 37 of 44 on the underlying answer where one was called for (84.1%); the model answered 476 of 511 on presence (93.2%) and 141 of 174 on answer (81.0%); on the holdout, where only matchers operate, presence accuracy was 173 of 176 (98.3%) and answer accuracy 22 of 23 (95.7%). These figures aren’t directly comparable. A matcher answers only the instances it trusts and refers the rest back to the model, so its accuracy is measured over an easier subset by construction. The honest claim is equivalent-or-better on the instances a matcher chooses to answer, not better than the model in general.

## The adjudication

Every one of the 80 disagreements between the pipeline and the key was read by hand, not sampled. About 15 of them, roughly a fifth, turned out to be the key itself in error or arguably so – a misspelled party name, a date recorded in the wrong format for CUAD’s own convention, an agreement date contradicting the very span the key quotes as its own evidence. This is not a defect hunt. CUAD’s annotators did expert legal work, valued by the dataset’s own authors at over two million dollars, and we are marking against it for free; set against everything marked, those rows amount to roughly 2%. An error margin that size, surfacing only in the contested rows, is what expert annotation looks like – and it is exactly why a marked-not-trusted pipeline matters in the first place.

One disagreement is worth naming precisely because it isn’t a key error. The Non-Compete matcher’s induction set included a case where the model read an employment contract’s outside-activities clause as a non-compete (Theravance) – a call the key disputes. The overseer learned it faithfully anyway, because an overseer learns from what the model accepted, not from what is true. That is why the answer key has to stay out of the induction loop. An overseer that could see it would launder the key into “deterministic” code, and the marking that makes this report honest would mean nothing.

## What it cost

All figures here are labelled estimates – published Sonnet prices against measured subagent tokens, banded rather than exact. The run’s central estimate is about $10.9 at introductory pricing (about $16.4 at list). This isn’t a crossover story like our invoice case study, where an eventual cost curve favours automation. The saving here is the residual – reading the 100-contract holdout with the model would cost an estimated $10.4 at the stream’s own mean cost per read, and the matchers answered the same 176 categories for nothing. That zero-marginal-cost coverage, on exactly the categories judged safe to automate, is the number worth keeping.

## What transfers and what does not

What generalises is the method, not the twelve answers it produced this time. That a matcher can pass its own exam and still fail completely on new documents (Audit Rights) is a finding about deterministic code in general, not about this corpus. So is the fact that a computed answer is the one place a text-pattern matcher is most dangerous to trust (Expiration Date), and that “bespoke” and “boilerplate” are properties of an instance as often as of a category. What does not generalise is the count itself – which twelve questions, what share automates, how these numbers land – because that depends on the documents in front of you, not on the method reading them. This closes what the ERP and invoice case studies opened – formats, then suppliers, then the categories of language, learned the same way each time, from what the model accepted rather than from anything we knew in advance.
