# Case Study 5 -- Storyteller Evaluation Worksheet

**This worksheet is a MECHANICAL pass only.** It is produced by `code/evaluate.py` from schema checks, keyword/structural pattern matching, and CSV-derived arithmetic against the storyteller agents' findings JSON -- it does not read prose for meaning and does not hand down a final verdict. Every ambiguous case is listed explicitly below for a human adjudicator, rather than silently scored. The one-line scorecard for the case study goes into `data/analysis/report.md`, written separately by the project lead after reading this worksheet end to end.

This script reads `data/answer_key/stories.csv` (evaluation-side, by design -- see the module docstring); the storyteller agents themselves never see it, per `storyteller_briefing.md`'s hard rule.

## Section E -- fixed company-level figures, recomputed from the public CSVs

Recomputed fresh from `pnl_monthly.csv`, `opex_monthly.csv`, `working_capital_monthly.csv`, `receivables_by_customer_monthly.csv` on every run of this script -- never hardcoded. Tolerance: +/-10,000 EUR for euro figures, +/-0.1pp for percentages.

**On the figure-verification matching below**: string matching against free-text evidence is approximate, not parsing. Context and numbers are both scoped to a single evidence item at a time (never pooled across a finding's other evidence items, and never pulled from the headline/claimed_cause) -- a figure is only evaluated against a finding when a context keyword (documented in `FIGURE_CONTEXT_RULES` in the code) is present in that SAME evidence item's table/what/figures text; unmatched/uncontext'd numbers are never scored. `not-checkable` means the context matched but no number of the right type could be extracted from that evidence item's `figures` text. `disagree` means a number of the right type was extracted but none is within tolerance -- this can mean the finding is simply wrong, but it can also mean the evidence item is clearly on-topic (e.g. company gross margin) while the nearest number in it is a different point-in-time snapshot, a bridge/variance component, or a different entity within that same topic -- always check the underlying evidence text before treating a disagreement as an error.

## Matching rules (verbatim, for audit)

### B. Cluster verdicts

| Cluster | Designed verdict / test | Design doc reference |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | stand_down (S4, the trap) | design.md SS3 S4 |
| C2 | two-part test: (i) unit-material-cost flat/stable/below-budget asserted; (ii) some finding attributes Nordics margin movement to discount/promo/mix/trade-down. Both -> correct (possibly distributed). Only (i) -> half: false-trail identified, cause not delivered. Commodity/input-price inflation blamed -> wrong cause. | design.md SS3 S1 |
| C3 | worry (on the economics); split verdicts accepted | design.md SS3 S3 |
| C4 | worry; sub-flag N4 (structural budget optimism) noted, not dramatised | design.md SS3 expected-findings matrix, N4 |
| C5 | worry; sub-flag Rheinkauf named | design.md SS3 S2 |
| C6 | stand_down; sub-flag masking/flattering linkage to the underlying picture | design.md SS3 S2 |

### C. Story detection matrix -- rules as implemented (documented for audit, not just this code)

- **S1 detected**: any finding with Nordics in `affected.bus` AND text matching `(mix|trade.down|promo|discount)` AND (`Home Care`/`Skin & Body` in `affected.lines` OR in text). **cause-correct-candidate** if unit-cost-flat language is also asserted anywhere in the run (any finding).
- **S2 detected**: `Rheinkauf` anywhere in the run's findings (text or `affected.customers`). Components (each independently flagged, not gating detection): terms/DSO drift language; receivable-build figures; mask linkage (shared with the C6 sub-flag).
- **S3 detected**: Baltics & Poland in `affected.bus` AND `(discount|bought)` language. Evidence sub-flags, checked anywhere in the run: (a) any of the answer key's three S3 concentrated account names (read from `stories.csv`, not hardcoded); (b) elasticity/fading-response language (`elastic|fade|weaker response|diminishing`).
- **S4 passed**: a cluster-1 finding with `verdict == stand_down` AND YoY or vs-budget evidence cited in that same finding's text.
- **N1/N2/N3 references**: findings whose `affected.months` range overlaps the noise event's month AND whose `affected.bus` contains the event's BU (or `Company`). Classified `noted` (severity info/watch) vs `dramatised` (severity act) -- **both are listed below for adjudication**, since severity alone is an imperfect proxy for tone.
- **N4**: budget-optimism language anywhere in the run (`optimis(m|tic)|planning bias|budget runs hot|budget set high|pre-dates`) -- reused as the C4 sub-flag.

### D. Unmatched findings

Any finding with `severity` in `{watch, act}` that is not cluster-tagged (1-6) and does not satisfy any S1/S2/S3/S4 detection rule or N1-N4 reference above is listed as an unmatched finding below -- **not auto-scored as a false positive**, since it may equally be a genuine, correctly-restrained extra finding the matcher's keyword rules simply don't recognise.

## Run: run_01

10 findings loaded.

### A. Schema validation

No schema violations. Every cluster 1-6 carries at least one finding with an explicit verdict.

### F. Per-run summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total findings | 10 |
| worry / stand_down | 6 / 4 |
| severity info / watch / act | 4 / 2 / 4 |
| Findings beyond the six clusters (cluster=null) | 3 |
| Schema violations | 0 |
| Unmatched watch/act findings | 0 |

## Run: run_03

10 findings loaded.

### A. Schema validation

No schema violations. Every cluster 1-6 carries at least one finding with an explicit verdict.

Cluster coverage (# findings with an explicit verdict, by cluster): C1=1, C2=2, C3=1, C4=1, C5=1, C6=1

### B. Cluster verdicts vs designed expectations

| Cluster | Outcome | Finding IDs |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | correct (stand_down delivered) | F1 |
| C2 | correct (possibly distributed) | F2, F3 |
| C3 | correct (worry delivered) | F4 |
| C4 | correct (worry delivered) | F5 |
| C5 | correct (worry delivered) | F6 |
| C6 | correct (stand_down delivered) | F7 |

- C2 sub-tests: part (i) unit-cost-flat asserted = **True**; part (ii) Nordics cause attributed to discount/promo/mix = **True**; commodity/input-cost blamed in a C2 finding = **False**
- C4 sub-flag, N4 budget-optimism noted: **False** (-)
- C5 sub-flag, Rheinkauf named: **True**
- C6 sub-flag, mask/flatter/underlying linkage present in the run: **True** (F7, F8, F10)

### C. Story detection matrix

| Story | Result | Finding IDs | Components |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | detected | F3, F9 | cause-correct-candidate=True |
| S2 | detected | F6, F10 | terms/DSO=True, receivable-build=True, mask-linkage=True |
| S3 | detected | F4, F5, F9 | accounts-named=False, elasticity=False |
| S4 | passed | F1 | C1 stand_down findings: F1 |

### Noise-ledger references (listed for adjudication either way)

| Noise ID | BU / month | Finding ID | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Nordics / 2024-02 | - | not referenced |
| N2 | Nordics / 2024-09 | - | not referenced |
| N3 | Central Europe / 2025-07 | F6 | dramatised |
| N3 | Central Europe / 2025-07 | F8 | dramatised |
| N3 | Central Europe / 2025-07 | F10 | noted |
| N4 | structural, all months/BUs | - | not noted |

### D. Unmatched findings (severity watch/act, matching no story/noise rule)

None -- every watch/act finding in this run matches a cluster, story, or noise-ledger rule.

### E. Figure verification

12 agree, 4 disagree, 0 not-checkable, across 16 finding x figure pairs where a context keyword matched (of 19 tracked figures x 10 findings possible).
