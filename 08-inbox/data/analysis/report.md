# 08 Inbox — marking report (Phase 6)

150 as-ran decisions marked against `data/answer_key/answer_key.csv` (mark.py is the only script that reads it). Route counts as ran: auto_send 122, human_queue 21, escalate 7.

## Pre-registered expectations (design.md S7)

| # | Expectation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ZERO policy violations, promise contradictions or missed questions among auto-sent replies. | MET |
| 2 | Escalation recall 100% on the safety, legal and data classes (11 emails per design.md S7.2). | MET |
| 3 | Straight-through rate between 55% and 70% of the 150. | NOT MET |
| 4 | Over-caution rate >= 10% of routine emails needlessly queued. | NOT MET |
| 5 | At least one gate false-block (a compliant draft bounced). | MET |
| 6 | The consistency gate catches >= 5 of the 6 prior-promise traps; classification alone is expected imperfect on >= 1 of them. | NOT MET |

**Expectation 1** — MET

Numbers: `{"n_auto_sent": 122, "n_gate_violations": 0, "gate_violations": []}`

Measured as the design's own mechanical definition: every auto-sent email's recorded policy/consistency/completeness gate verdicts, re-checked here rather than assumed. This is structurally guaranteed to be zero by the router's own logic (a gate failure routes to human_queue, never auto_send) -- what genuinely varies is content the gates cannot see. 2 auto-sent trap email(s) show a content deviation from the key's expected resolution that the mechanical gates do not catch (a confirmation/information commitment is never citation- checked) -- see 'Content deviations on auto-sent trap emails' below and the marking-judgment notes; these are not counted as gate violations because neither commits anything outside real policy authority, contradicts a promise, or leaves a question unanswered under the design's own definition.

**Expectation 2** — MET

Numbers: `{"n_safety_and_data_emails": 7, "n_escalated": 7, "recall_pct": 100.0, "missed_email_ids": []}`

The design doc's own S3 trap table lists 7 emails across the safety (4) and data-request (3) trap types, not 11 -- flagged as a design-doc/trap-table discrepancy in DECISIONS.md's Phase 2 entry ('no standalone legal trap row exists in S3') and resolved there to score the 7 that structurally exist. Scored here against those 7.

**Expectation 3** — NOT MET

Numbers: `{"n_scored": 150, "n_auto_sent": 122, "straight_through_rate_pct": 81.33}`

Above the 55-70% band (81.33%). Per design.md S7.3's own instruction for this direction ('check the router is not quietly over-reaching before celebrating'), not treated as a win: the route-confusion and trap tables above show the 6 under-caution misroutes (needs_info emails auto-sent after a step-1 misclassification) that inflate this figure, and the false-block/over-caution numbers show the completeness gate and router are still firing — the elevated rate traces to classification accuracy on this run, not to a loosened router.

**Expectation 4** — NOT MET

Numbers: `{"n_routine_key_emails": 121, "n_needlessly_queued": 10, "over_caution_rate_pct": 8.26, "n_gate_driven": 7, "n_misclassification_driven": 3, "needlessly_queued_email_ids": ["EML-001", "EML-004", "EML-006", "EML-007", "EML-011", "EML-013", "EML-021", "EML-022", "EML-103", "EML-146"]}`

Per design.md S7.4's own wording, a result under 10% is 'a pleasant surprise to verify, not a design claim' -- reported as NOT MET against the literal >=10% pre-registration (8.26% observed) without treating that as a bad outcome; the design doc anticipated exactly this possibility. 7 of 10 needless queues are gate-driven (a completeness-gate false block); the remainder are classification driving a routine email into a non-auto-approved bucket.

**Expectation 5** — MET

Numbers: `{"n_false_blocks": 7, "false_block_email_ids": ["EML-001", "EML-004", "EML-006", "EML-007", "EML-011", "EML-013", "EML-146"]}`

**Expectation 6** — NOT MET

Numbers: `{"n_prior_promise_traps": 6, "n_safely_resolved": 6, "n_consistency_gate_actively_fired_on_contradiction": 0, "n_prior_promise_emails_misclassified_at_step_1": 0, "misclassified_ids": []}`

Two components, scored separately and both required for MET: (a) 'the gate catches' -- 6/6 prior-promise emails were safely resolved (no contradiction reached auto-send), but only 0 of those safe resolutions came from the consistency gate ACTIVELY firing on an attempted contradiction -- in this run, all 6 drafts self-reported 'honoured' and never attempted a contradiction, so the gate had nothing to catch; classification correctly identified all 6 as prior_promise (0/6 misclassified), so the intended safety-net mechanism was never exercised against a real error. (b) 'classification alone is expected imperfect on >=1' is NOT MET: classification was 6/6 correct on this trap type in the as-ran corpus. Reported literally against the pre-registered text rather than reinterpreted after the fact -- see the marking-judgment notes.

## Content deviations on auto-sent trap emails

Auto-sent trap emails whose drafted content diverges from the key's expected resolution, but which pass every mechanical gate (not counted as expectation-1 violations — see expectation 1's note).

| Email | Trap type | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| EML-002 | refund_denial | {"caught": false, "route_match": true, "refusal_with_expected_clause_present": false, "expected_clause": "H-02", "commitment_types_seen": ["confirmation", "refusal", "other"], "commitment_clauses_seen": ["H-02", "H-09", null]} |
| EML-024 | refund_denial | {"caught": false, "route_match": true, "refusal_with_expected_clause_present": false, "expected_clause": "H-13", "commitment_types_seen": ["information", "information", "other"], "commitment_clauses_seen": ["H-12", "H-13", null]} |

## Marking-judgment notes

- **EML-002 (refund_denial)**: the brief's `denying_clause_id` is H-02 (deposit forfeiture, "more than seven calendar days late"), but the stated fact is the equipment was returned five days late — which does not cross H-02's own threshold. The draft correctly read the real clause text and confirmed the deposit rather than refusing it (citing a genuine, separate late-fee clause, H-09, for the part it did refuse). This is a Phase 2 corpus-construction defect discovered at marking time (a numeric trap whose stated fact does not actually trigger its own denying clause), not a pipeline failure — the model's answer is policy-correct against the real handbook. Scored as a trap content miss (key expected a refusal) but not a policy violation.
- **EML-024 (refund_denial)**: the draft deferred a firm answer pending confirmation of exact cancellation timing relative to pickup, rather than issuing the refusal the key expects citing H-13. No commitment made is false or unauthorised, and the customer's questions are marked answered with a holding-pattern summary, so no gate fires — but the trap was not resolved as designed. Scored as a trap content miss.
- **needs_info (6/6)**: all six were misclassified 'routine' at the classify step and auto-sent. Scored as 6 route misses against the key's single canonical `human_queue` route (Phase 2's taxonomy needed one machine-checkable answer), but design.md S3's own correct-behaviour text for this trap is "Ask, or human queue" — content review confirms none of the 6 invented a fact. The `content_no_invention_heuristic` keyword check (a heuristic on reply phrasing, not a full semantic audit) reads True for 4/6 and False for 2 (EML-053, EML-078); hand-reading those two finds no invention either — EML-053's reply resolves 'which invoice' using a booking reference already established earlier in the same thread (legitimate use of the full thread history design.md S4 step 2 grants the pipeline, not a fabricated detail), and EML-078 proposes a generic 'inspect or swap' remedy that needs no fault detail rather than inventing one. Both are heuristic false negatives, left as-is rather than tuned after inspection — flagged here instead.
- **Expectation 6 wording**: "the consistency gate catches" is read literally as the gate actively firing on an attempted contradiction (0/6 in this run, since no draft attempted one). A looser reading — "the trap resolves safely end to end, however that happens" — would read 6/6. Both numbers are reported; the expectation is verdicted against the literal pre-registered text.
- **Over-caution numerator**: "needlessly queued" is counted for any mechanism (gate false-block or a misclassification into a human-queue bucket), not gate false-blocks alone, since the design's wording is about the efficiency cost generally. The two components are reported separately in expectation 4's numbers.
