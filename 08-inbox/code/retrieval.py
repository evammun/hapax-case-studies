"""
08 Inbox — Phase 4 deterministic retrieval (design.md §4 step 2).

Everything in this module is deterministic Python — no model call, no
randomness. It reads exactly three kinds of in-world artefact: the policy
handbook, the customer register, and the prose thread history. It never
opens `data/answer_key/`, `data/threads/` (the structured, ground-truth
version), or `data/email_briefs/` — those carry intent_class/trap_type/
promise fields that would hand the pipeline the answer directly (see
`assemble_emails.py`'s "Design decisions" note). The pipeline is only ever
allowed to know what a human agent opening the real inbox would know.

Functions are split into loaders (I/O, read the data/ tree) and pure
retrieval logic (no I/O, operate on already-loaded structures) so the pure
functions can be unit-tested against hand-built fixtures without touching
disk at all.
