"""
08 Inbox — Phase 4 deterministic gates + router (design.md §4 steps 4-5).

This module is the pipeline's entire judgment-free core: three gates and a
router, every one a pure function over structured data. No function here
makes a model call, reads a file, or uses randomness — they operate only on
the draft's own structured JSON output (whatever the future draft-writing
model emits, following the contract in `build_draft_tasks.py`) plus facts
already retrieved deterministically by `retrieval.py`. This is what "gates
(deterministic)" means in design.md §4: the semantic work of reading English
happened one step earlier, in the model's draft; the gate only checks that
the draft's own structured self-report is internally consistent with the
in-world artefacts (design.md §4: "Gates check internal consistency against
in-world artefacts only") — never against the answer key, which this module
never imports or reads.

Because every function is pure, this module is unit-tested against
hand-built fixtures kept in the session scratchpad, never against pytest
files committed under code/.
