"""
08 Inbox — Phase 3 prose coherence validator.

Every coherence rule below corresponds to a hard requirement, either stated
directly in the design doc, carried over from validate_structure.py's
Phase 2 rules (which this script does not re-check — those already passed),
or implied by the prose-agent contract in build_prose_tasks.py ("may never
add or remove a planted signal"; no leaked pipeline vocabulary). A corpus
that fails this script is a bug, not a judgment call — it exits 1 on ANY
failure, the same convention as validate_structure.py.

Checks:
  1. Completeness: every EML-001..150 has an assembled email file; every
     thread has an assembled thread-with-prose file whose message set
     (index, sender, date, timestamp) matches data/threads/ exactly.
  2. Non-trivial prose: every subject and body is non-empty and above a
     minimum length (catches a degenerate or truncated writer response).
  3. Planted signals are locatable: for every trap type, the facts the
     brief planted (an amount, a percentage, a rental reference, a
     scenario) are actually findable — verbatim for numeric/code facts,
     keyword-matched for descriptive facts — in the corresponding email or
     staff-reply body. This is the corpus-level version of "the writer may
     never add or remove a planted signal."
  4. Prior-promise integrity in prose: for each of the 6 prior-promise
     threads, the staff reply immediately preceding the trap email
     genuinely carries the planted promise in its prose (keyword-matched by
     promise kind) — this is now the ONLY place the promise lives, since
     assemble_emails.py deliberately drops the structured `promise` block
     from the pipeline-facing corpus.
  5. No leaked answer-key vocabulary: no trap-type or intent-class machine
     token, no route-label token, no internal clause-id code (H-NN), no
     promise-id code (PROM-0N), no literal reference to "the answer key" or
     "the trap", and never the word "fraud" (the design's own rule),
     anywhere in the assembled prose.
  6. Thread chronology is coherent: message dates/timestamps strictly
     increase within a thread (re-checked independently on the assembled
     prose files, not assumed from Phase 2's validation).
  7. Name consistency with structure: every assembled thread's customer_id/
     name and every staff message's staff_id/name/role match the customer
     register / config.STAFF exactly — no drift introduced during assembly.

Run: python validate_emails.py
Exit 0 = all rules pass. Exit 1 = at least one rule failed (details printed).
