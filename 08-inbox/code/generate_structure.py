"""
08 Inbox — Phase 2 deterministic structure generator.

Builds, in order:
  1. The policy handbook (data/policy/handbook.yaml + handbook.md) — ~30 numbered
     clauses, internally consistent so the traps genuinely bind.
  2. The customer register (data/customers/register.csv).
  3. Thread skeletons (data/threads/thread_NNN.json) — which customer, how many
     messages, dates, and (for the 6 prior-promise traps) the prior staff
     reply's planted promise.
  4. Email briefs (data/email_briefs/brief_NNN.json) — one per inbound email:
     customer, thread position, intent class, facts, trap mechanics, tone notes.
  5. The answer key (data/answer_key/answer_key.csv) — correct route, binding
     clauses, correct commitments, trap class. Read by nothing but the future
     code/mark.py.

Deterministic Python controls all of the above; nothing here is prose. Later
phases add LLM-written email and staff-reply text on top of this structure —
prose agents dramatise, they never add or remove a planted signal.

Run: python generate_structure.py
Then: python validate_structure.py   (must exit 0)
