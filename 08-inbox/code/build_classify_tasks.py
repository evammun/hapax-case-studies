08 Inbox — Phase 4 pipeline, stage 1: classify task-file builder
(design.md §4 step 1, "Classify intent (model)").

Builds one self-contained classification task per inbound email plus
fixed-size batches, for the classify agent that will run in Phase 5 (a
separately gated LLM run — this script makes no LLM calls and does not
trigger one). This mirrors the portfolio's house method for a not-yet-run
LLM stage (Case 10's build_extraction_tasks.py): deterministic Python
decides everything about the task's shape and contract; the model only
fills in the answer.

Per design.md §4, classification happens BEFORE retrieval — a task here
carries only the trigger email's own content (subject, body, and its
position in its thread), never the rest of the thread, the policy
handbook, or the customer record. This is deliberate: design §7
expectation 6 expects classification alone to be imperfect on at least one
of the six prior-promise-contradiction cases, with the downstream
consistency gate (which DOES see the full thread) catching what
classification misses. Giving the classifier full context here would
collapse that distinction before Phase 5 even runs.

This script reads `data/emails/email_*.json` only — the assembled,
ground-truth-stripped corpus (see assemble_emails.py's "Design decisions"
note). It never reads `data/threads/`, `data/email_briefs/`, or
`data/answer_key/`, all of which carry intent_class/trap_type/promise
ground truth that would hand the classifier the answer directly.

Run: python build_classify_tasks.py

Outputs:
  data/pipeline/classify_tasks/task_EML-NNN.json   -- one per email (150)
  data/pipeline/classify_batches/batch_NN.json     -- fixed-size batches,
                                                       output contract
                                                       embedded

Ends with a self-validation pass (structural checks on what this script
just wrote), exits 1 on any failure, per the portfolio's "a dataset that
fails validation is a bug" rule.
