"""Arm 3 of the four-arm baseline comparison (Project 10, design.md S8a) --
the disciplined local LLM: the workflow's own extraction contract (refuse-to-
guess, verbatim citations, no verdicts, ask-in-screening), run on the same
small model as arm 2 (Haiku, as stand-in for "a local model"). This arm
isolates the case's hero claim: if it lands near arm 4 (the full workflow,
already run on Sonnet) and far above arm 2 (the naive prompt on the same
model), the delta is the DISCIPLINE, not the parameter count.

Deliberately thin: this module owns no contract logic of its own. It imports
`load_applications`, `requirement_profile_for_extraction`, `build_task`, and
`EXTRACTION_CONTRACT` straight from `build_extraction_tasks.py` so arms 3 and
4 run the byte-identical contract on the byte-identical per-candidate task
content -- the ONLY difference between this script's output and
`data/extraction_batches/` is the output-path instruction embedded in each
batch (telling whoever launches the Haiku run where to write results), plus
an `arm` label. Task content, requirement profile, and `output_contract` are
produced by the exact same functions arm 4 already used.

This script never reads data/answer_key.csv or data/answer_key_candidates.csv.

Run: python build_disciplined_tasks.py   (after
                                           data/applications_raw/ exists --
                                           same precondition as
                                           build_extraction_tasks.py)

Outputs:
  data/disciplined_batches/batch_NN.json   -- 30 batches of 8, same contract
                                               as data/extraction_batches/,
                                               output_path pointed at
                                               data/disciplined_raw/
