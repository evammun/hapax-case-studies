"""Build per-candidate extraction tasks for the dossier-extraction workflow
(Project 10, Phase 3 -- design.md S3, "the workflow under test").

Reads the written application prose from `data/applications_raw/batch_NN.json`
(Phase 2 output, session data -- never regenerated, only read) and the 12
frozen requirements from `code/config.py`, and emits one extraction task per
candidate plus 8-candidate batches for the extraction agents that will run in
Phase 3b (a separately gated LLM run -- this script makes no LLM calls and
does not trigger one).

This script never reads `data/answer_key.csv` or `data/answer_key_candidates.csv`
-- per the portfolio's standing rule, nothing touches the key except the
marking script (Phase 5). The extraction agent must work from the application
text alone, exactly as a real extraction system would.

The extraction contract embedded in every task/batch is the load-bearing part
of this script: it tells the agent to *refuse to guess* (design.md S3's
refuse-to-guess gate -- anything not explicitly and unambiguously stated
becomes `not_stated`, never an inference) and to *never rank, recommend, or
verdict* the candidate (design.md S1's standing constraint -- the system
assists, it never decides). Every requirement's status classification must
carry a verbatim, source-tagged quote so `assemble_dossiers.py` can verify
citations against the actual application text later.

Run: python build_extraction_tasks.py   (after Phase 2's application-writer
                                          batches exist under
                                          data/applications_raw/)

Outputs:
  data/extraction_tasks/task_CNNN.json     -- one per candidate (240)
  data/extraction_batches/batch_NN.json    -- 30 batches of 8, output
                                               contract embedded, same
                                               numbering as brief_batches

Ends with a self-validation pass (structural checks on what this script just
wrote -- every candidate present, every task carries all 12 requirements, no
answer-key vocabulary or fields leaked, batch counts reconcile). Exits 1 on
any failure, per the portfolio's "a dataset that fails validation is a bug"
rule.
