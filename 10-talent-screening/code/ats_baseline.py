"""Arm 1 of the four-arm baseline comparison (Project 10, design.md S8a) --
the deterministic ATS: a keyword/synonym matcher of the kind a real
applicant-tracking system runs, scored over the 240 written applications.

This is a RANKING tool -- deliberately the opposite shape from the Hapax
workflow under test (design.md S1: "no ranking, no shortlist, ... the
recruiter decides"). That is the whole point of the exhibit: arm 1's output
is a ranked list, clearly labelled as the baseline's own output, and it lives
only under data/baselines/ -- never inside a dossier, never presented as
system output.

LOUD WARNING, read before touching SYNONYM_TABLE below:
    The synonym lists in this file are built from the REQUIREMENT TEXT in
    config.REQUIREMENTS ONLY (the id/name/description a real ATS vendor
    would be handed when the client fills in a job-requirements form), plus
    plain-English synonyms a generic ATS vendor would plausibly ship for
    that vocabulary. This file must NEVER read config.DISPLACEMENT_TABLE --
    that table is key-side trap knowledge (design.md S2's hidden-gem
    subplot), and copying its domain-specific phrasing into the ATS's own
    dictionary would rig pre-registration A2 (the ATS should plausibly MISS
    displaced vocabulary, not be handed the answer). A self-check assertion
    below (`assert_no_displacement_leak`) enforces this mechanically: every
    synonym string is checked against every displacement-table phrase.

Scoring scheme (documented, not buried in logic -- see CONFIG block):
    Each of the 12 requirements gets a binary hit flag per candidate: 1 if
    ANY of its synonyms appears as a case-insensitive substring anywhere in
    the scored text, 0 otherwise. This is a genuine simplification real
    keyword-matching ATSes share -- literal substring/keyword screens do not
    weigh repeat mentions, and multiple hits for the same requirement count
    once. The per-candidate score is a weighted sum of hit flags:
    must-have hits x3, desirable hits x2, constraint hits x1 (design.md
    S8a's own weighting instruction). Two variants are scored:
      - full text (CV + cover letter concatenated) -- the "generous" primary
        configuration design.md S8a calls for.
      - CV only -- the sensitivity check, since real ATSes often never
        ingest the cover letter at all.

Rank: descending by score, ties broken deterministically by candidate_id
ascending (see RANK_TIE_BREAK below) -- every candidate gets a unique rank,
so "no ties broken non-deterministically" (validate_baselines.py's check)
holds by construction.

This script never reads data/answer_key.csv or data/answer_key_candidates.csv
-- per the portfolio's standing rule, nothing but the marking script reads
the key. It only ever reads config.py (requirement text) and
data/applications_raw/ (written CV/letter prose).

Run: python ats_baseline.py

Outputs:
  data/baselines/ats_scores.csv          -- full-text variant (primary)
  data/baselines/ats_scores_cv_only.csv  -- CV-only sensitivity variant
