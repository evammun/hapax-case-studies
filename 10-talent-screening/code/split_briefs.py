"""Batch the 240 application-writer briefs into 30 files of 8 for the
application-writer agent, each batch carrying the output contract the
writer must return.

Mirrors the churn case's split_briefs.py / the tender case's
attempt_briefs pattern: Python decides batching, never the agent.

Run: python split_briefs.py   (after generate_structured.py and
