"""Configuration for the talent-screening corpus generator (Project 10, Phase 1).

Every tunable lives here: RANDOM_SEED, the requirement profile (12 requirements,
design.md S2), the vocabulary-displacement table for the hidden-gem archetype,
the archetype table (design.md S2, exact counts), demographic-stratum name
pools and target proportions, the fictional employer, the 12 recruiter-persona
definitions and the 48-application persona subset, and every evidence-location
and status vocabulary used downstream.

Per the Hapax core generation pattern: this module controls STRUCTURE only.
No CV prose, no cover-letter prose, no chat transcript language is written
here or by generate_structured.py -- that is Phase 2/3 LLM-agent
(application-writer) work, constrained to never add or remove what this file
plants.

Spec update (Eva, mid-build, effective immediately): every application is a
CV *and* a substantive one-page cover letter (Finnish application
convention). "cover_letter" is therefore a first-class evidence location
alongside work_history / project_description / skills_list, and some planted
evidence items are deliberately LETTER-ONLY -- present nowhere else in the
application. The clearest use of this is the hidden-gem archetype (F): half
of F's 18 candidates have their displaced skill surface only in the letter,
which is a strictly harder plant than displacement alone. Keyword stuffers
(D) also lean on the letter, since unsubstantiated claims naturally "bloom"
in motivational prose. See LETTER_ONLY_* constants below.

Company-name collision check (recorded in full in design/DECISIONS.md, to be
independently re-checked by a `scout` agent per the task brief): **Kaikuvaara
Oy**, a fictional Finnish remote-sensing instruments maker, headquartered in
Oulu (a genuine Finnish hub for RF/photonics/space-systems industry -- VTT,
the University of Oulu's wireless research, and the local space-systems
cluster all sit there, so the setting is grounded without naming any real
employer). "Kaiku" (echo) + "vaara" (fell/hill) follows the portfolio's
existing naming convention (a Finnish nature/landscape word plus a plain
suffix: Jalavakoski [02], Pyokkipaja [03], Paju Consumer Products [05],
Saarnitukku [06], Visakoivu [07]) and reads naturally as a company name while
evoking radar/sonar echo returns, which fits a remote-sensing instruments
maker thematically. A quick web check at build time found no company trading
under this exact name; the word "kaikuvaara" does not appear to be in generic
use as a company or brand name in Finland. Distinct from all six existing
portfolio protagonist companies listed above.
