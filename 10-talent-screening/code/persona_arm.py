"""Simulated-recruiter persona arm -- SKELETON (Project 10, Phase 3 --
design.md S3, "the human arm").

Task-generation for both arms is implemented and runnable now, from
`data/persona_subset.json` (12 personas x the 48-candidate stratified
subset): it needs only the persona roster and, for the assisted arm, the
assembled dossiers. The SCORING side -- comparing a persona's screening
response against the answer key to test pre-registrations 3, 4, 5, and 6 --
is a documented STUB ONLY. Marking is Phase 4/5 work, downstream of both this
harness and the extraction workflow's marking script, and (like every other
script in this project except the eventual marking script) this module never
reads data/answer_key.csv or data/answer_key_candidates.csv.

Two arms, same 48 candidates, same personas, same fixed time budget
(config.PERSONA_ARM_TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS -- see config.py for why that number
is a flagged builder judgment call):

  unaided  -- application text (CV + cover letter) + the bare requirement
              profile + the time-budget framing. No dossier. This is the
              persona reading the application cold, exactly as an unaided
              human recruiter would.
  assisted -- the same, PLUS the assembled dossier
              (data/dossiers/dossier_CNNN.json) placed beside the
              application. Requires Phase 3b's extraction run and
              assemble_dossiers.py to have produced that candidate's
              dossier; candidates without one are skipped with a clear log
              line, never silently dropped or faked.

Emits one task file per persona per arm (not one per persona-candidate pair
-- 12 personas x 2 arms = 24 files, each holding that persona's 48
candidate-tasks in application order), mirroring the batch-file convention
used everywhere else in this project:

  data/persona_tasks/unaided/persona_PNN.json
  data/persona_tasks/assisted/persona_PNN.json
