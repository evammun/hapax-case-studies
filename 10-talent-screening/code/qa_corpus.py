"""Phase-2-close corpus QA for case 10 (Talent Screening).

Runs the mechanical QA checklist accumulated in design/DECISIONS.md (18 Sep
2026, "Phase-2-close QA checklist" plus the degree-ambiguity notes) against
the *current* state of `data/applications_raw/`. This script never edits
corpus content -- it only reads `data/briefs/`, `data/applications_raw/`,
`data/answer_key.csv` and `data/answer_key_candidates.csv`, and writes a
report to `data/qa_corpus_report.txt` plus a summary to stdout.

Seven checks, each producing zero or more Finding records (PASS is implicit;
only WARN/FAIL are recorded as findings):

  1. Completeness       -- hard FAIL: missing batch files, missing/duplicate
                            candidate ids, empty document fields, stray
                            *.part files.
  2. No future dates     -- hard FAIL: a real year later than 2026 anywhere
                            in cv_markdown / cover_letter_markdown.
  3. Name integrity      -- hard FAIL: own full name missing from own CV,
                            duplicate full names, another candidate's full
                            name leaking into a candidate's documents.
  4. Displacement (F)    -- hard FAIL: the canonical requirement term is
                            present, or no recognisable stem of the
                            assigned displaced phrase is present.
  5. Degree-field rule   -- hard FAIL on a relevant-field term inside the
                            education section of an R05-absent/not-stated/
                            claimed-only candidate; WARN on an
                            ambiguous-relevance term (per the C148/C198/C218
                            precedent in DECISIONS.md).
  6. Cover-letter-only    -- FAIL if a CV contains a strong/specific keyword
     placement               for a requirement whose key entry is located
                            in the cover letter; WARN on a generic keyword
                            (human review).
  7. Not-to-mention scan -- WARN only: any keyword hit for a requirement the
                            brief marks not_to_mention, anywhere in either
                            document, with context (keyword matches can be
                            innocent -- e.g. an employer name).

Run: `python code/qa_corpus.py` from the project root or from `code/`.
Exit code 1 if any hard FAIL is found anywhere (including an incomplete
corpus); 0 otherwise. A dataset failing this script is a bug in the
generator/writer flow to fix upstream -- this script never patches corpus
content itself.
