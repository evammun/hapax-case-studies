"""One-off repair script: 7 duplicate full names across the 240-candidate
corpus (`assign_names()` in generate_structured.py drew first names and
surnames independently and never checked the resulting FULL NAME for
corpus-wide uniqueness, so seven first+surname combinations collided).

This is a SURGICAL fix, not a regeneration: batches 03, 06, 08's prose
timeline fix already showed the pattern, but here the added constraint is
that some batches (notably batch_13, containing C104) have already had
prose written against them by the application-writer agent, so a full
re-run of generate_structured.py (which would re-shuffle every name pool
and rename candidates wholesale) is out of the question. Instead: rename
exactly one member of each duplicate pair -- always the one whose batch has
NOT been written yet, except the Emma Petrov pair (C015 / C104), where both
batches are written, so C104 (the more recently touched one) is renamed and
its already-written prose is patched in place (see patch_c104_prose()).

Read-only inputs: data/answer_key_candidates.csv (for the corpus-wide
full-name collision check).
Writes: the 7 affected data/briefs/brief_NNN.json files, their embedded
copies in data/brief_batches/batch_NN.json, the 7 corresponding rows in
data/answer_key_candidates.csv, and (C104 only) a text patch to
data/applications_raw/batch_13.json.

Run once: python fix_duplicate_names.py
Then:     python validate_structured.py   (now includes a full-name
                                            uniqueness check)
