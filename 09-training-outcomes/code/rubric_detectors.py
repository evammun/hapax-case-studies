"""
Rubric-item detectors for the 09 Training Outcomes case study.

Given a response answer's free text for one task, each detector returns the
SET of rubric-item numbers (1-based, in the item order defined in
`code/config.py`'s `TASK_PAIRS`) that the text's content satisfies.

These detectors are keyword/pattern based, not semantic. They exist because
Phase 3 response prose was generated from deterministic briefs that build an
answer by ADDING one content "atom" per rubric item earned (an "excellent"
band response contains every lower item's atom plus its own) -- see
design/DECISIONS.md's ability-to-band mapping. Content is genuinely
paraphrased across the five writing batches, though -- not one fixed
sentence per item -- so each item's detector looks for that item's
characteristic FACTS and CONCEPTS (specific figures, named clauses, named
steps, comparison words) via several alternative patterns, tuned by
sampling real corpus text across every rubric_items_hit group per task (see
DECISIONS.md, "Scorer calibration -- detector tuning"), not guessed from a
single example.

Used by:
- code/validate_responses.py -- a narrow fidelity check on tasks 7/8 only
  (the binary/enumerable policy tasks).
- code/score_responses.py -- the full calibration run across all 10 tasks.

IMPORTANT: detection here is calibrated AGAINST the response briefs (which
record the intended rubric_items_hit) for measurement purposes only. A real
scoring run (Phase 5's mark.py) would only ever see response text, never the
brief. Patterns below were broadened only in response to confirmed detector
misses (the text plainly satisfies/violates an item and the pattern missed
it) -- never to make a genuine response-infidelity case agree with its
brief. The eight Task-4/B4 files identified by the Task-3/4 cross-batch
audit (DECISIONS.md) are a deliberate, permanent exception: they SHOULD
disagree with the detector, because their prose contradicts their own
brief.
