"""
09 Training Outcomes -- Phase 3 closure: scorer calibration run.

This script is a CALIBRATION harness, not the production scorer. It runs the
keyword-based rubric-item detectors in `rubric_detectors.py` against every
one of the 240 Phase-3 response files and compares the detected hit-set for
each task against the corresponding response brief's `rubric_items_hit` --
the intended, briefed ground truth recorded when Phase 2 generated the
deterministic quality bands (see design/DECISIONS.md, "Ability-to-rubric-
band mapping").

A real scoring run (Phase 5's mark.py) would only ever see response text; it
would never read data/response_briefs/. Reading the briefs HERE is
deliberate and confined to this calibration script -- it is the only way to
measure whether the detectors (which mark.py will eventually reuse) are
trustworthy before they are relied on for real marking.

Two distinct failure modes are possible for any disagreement between the
detector and the brief, and they are NOT the same problem:
  (a) a detector bug -- the response text plainly satisfies (or plainly does
      not satisfy) a rubric item, but the keyword pattern missed it. Fix the
      detector.
  (b) a response infidelity -- the Phase-3 prose genuinely does not deliver
      what its brief promised (or, per the Task-3/4 audit, delivers content
      for an item it was not supposed to earn). This is a Phase-3 defect,
      listed here for regeneration, and must NEVER be "fixed" by loosening
      or tightening a detector to match it.

Iteration in this script's history therefore only ever touched
rubric_detectors.py in response to genuine detector bugs (confirmed by hand-
reading the disputed text), never to paper over a case (b).
