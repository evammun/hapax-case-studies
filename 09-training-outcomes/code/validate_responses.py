"""
09 Training Outcomes -- Phase 3 closure: corpus-wide response validation.

Validates all 240 Phase-3 response files (`data/responses/*.json`, written
by five parallel batch agents from the deterministic response briefs in
`data/response_briefs/`) against the manifest and against each file's own
brief. Every check below is a coherence rule from the Phase-3 spec; per
house convention, a dataset that fails validation is a bug, not a judgment
call. Exits 1 on any hard violation.

Checks, in order:
  1. Manifest completeness -- every `data/response_briefs/manifest.csv` row
     has a matching response file; no orphan response files.
  2. Schema -- required keys and types on every response file.
  3. Task-id order -- the 10 answers appear in task-index order for the
     file's form (A1..A10 or B1..B10), no gaps or duplicates.
  4. self_report byte-identity -- confidence/satisfaction in the response
     must exactly match the brief's self_report (Phase 3 prose generation
     must never touch these deterministic Phase-2 numbers).
  5. Banned-term scan -- meta/mechanism vocabulary that describes the
     SIMULATION'S internal machinery (rubric, archetype, band, practice
     effect, ...) should never appear in a learner's own answer text. This
     is a judgment call made for this closure task (no prior spec defines
     the list); see the BANNED_TERMS block below for the reasoning per
     term, and note the deliberate "planted error" exclusion.
  6. Rubric-fidelity check on the binary/enumerable policy tasks (A7/B7,
     A8/B8 only -- the narrow check called for in the Phase-3 spec,
     distinct from the full 10-task calibration run in score_responses.py):
     detect which of a task's rubric items the response text satisfies and
     compare against the brief's rubric_items_hit.

This script never modifies data/responses/ or data/response_briefs/ --
violations are reported for targeted regeneration, never hand-fixed here.
