"""
Configuration for the 09 Training Outcomes case study — Phase 2 (deterministic
structure).

Every tunable that controls the shape of the dataset lives in this file:
the random seed, the cohort archetype table, the Finnish learner-name pool
(collision-checked against the rest of the portfolio at import time), the
Kuusiharju Oy constants, and the task-set content for Forms A and B (the
published measurement instrument itself).

`code/generate_structure.py` reads this file and writes files; it does not
invent new parameters of its own. `code/validate_structure.py` re-derives
every coherence rule from the files on disk and checks them against the
values recorded here.

See `design/design.md` for the argument and `design/DECISIONS.md` for the
reasoning behind the numeric choices below (the ability-to-band mapping and
the δ/confidence independence tolerance in particular).

# The 40-learner cohort — archetypes fixed at the gate (design.md S2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every distribution below is a (mean, sd) pair for a normal draw, clipped
# to a sane range at generation time. Two independence rules the generator
# must honour (enforced by validate_structure.py):
#   1. confidence_delta_post is drawn from its OWN distribution per
#      archetype, never computed as a function of delta_post. The two are
#      correlated only through which archetype a learner belongs to — never
#      within an archetype. This is what makes the confident non-learner
#      and non-responder archetypes possible at all.
#   2. assessment_noise is drawn independently of both.
#
# Ability, delta and confidence all live on continuous scales:
#   - ability / delta: 0-1, where 1 is a flawless response on every rubric
#     item across the instrument (see "Ability-to-band mapping" below).
#   - confidence: 1-7 Likert-style continuous scale (self-report survey).
