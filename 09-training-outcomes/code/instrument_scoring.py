"""
Shared scoring / administration library for Phase 5 (09 Training Outcomes).

Used by both `run_instruments.py` (the three named instrument runs) and
`mark.py` (the perfect-scoring robustness pass and the naive-arm flaw
decomposition counterfactuals). Keeping this arithmetic in one place means
every consumer of "what does instrument X estimate for learner Y" goes
through the exact same code path -- there is no second, drifted copy of the
scoring or blending logic anywhere in Phase 5.

Two scoring MODES for a single (learner, form, occasion) task-performance
administration:
  - "scored"  -- the realistic, noisy layer: rubric_detectors.detect() run
    against the actual response TEXT in data/responses/. This is what a
    real deployment would use, and it inherits the scorer's measured
    94.23% item-level calibration (data/analysis/scorer_calibration.md).
  - "perfect" -- reads data/response_briefs/'s own points_earned/max_points
    directly (the intended, noise-free quality band Phase 2 planted before
    any prose was written). Used ONLY for the Phase 5 robustness check
    ("would any verdict flip under a perfect rater") -- never for the
    primary marking pass, and never by run_instruments.py.

Self-report values (confidence, satisfaction) are never touched by either
scoring mode: they are plain recorded numbers in every response file,
identical between "scored" and "perfect" runs by construction (Phase 2
wrote them once; Phase 3 prose never altered them -- validate_responses.py
already checked byte-identity against the brief). This is itself a finding
worth keeping visible in the robustness table: the feedback sheet
instrument cannot be affected by the scorer's reliability at all, because
it never scores response text.

Administrative fields read here (learner_id -> pre_form / post_form /
volunteer, from data/cohort/learners.csv) are logistics -- which form a
learner sat and when -- not the planted-truth columns (delta_post,
ability_*, confidence_baseline/delta/retention). Only those planted-truth
columns are "the answer key" in design.md's sense ("mark.py, sole reader of
the key"); this module never reads data/answer_key/, and neither does
run_instruments.py. Only mark.py opens that directory.
