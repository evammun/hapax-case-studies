ranking.py -- the one place the case decides how a ranked list is ordered and cut.

Why this file exists (method clarification recorded 6 Oct 2026, see
design/DECISIONS.md): the ticket-text agent's account score has only 33 distinct
values, so the top-100 cut fell inside a tie (23 accounts at 0.55 occupy ranks
95-117). The old code broke ties by row order (a stable sort on accounts.csv
order), which is arbitrary: it depends on nothing but how the data happens to be
laid out. Every top-N in the case is now cut by an explicit rule instead.

THE RULE (applied wherever a list is cut: top-50, top-100, ranks, 2x2 regions):

    Text arm      : score descending, then most recent ticket date descending
                    (a more recent concern outranks an older one at equal
                    score), then account_id ascending.
    Combined arm  : the same rule. The combined arm already reads ticket data,
                    so recency is a legitimate tie-break there.
    Usage arm     : score descending, then account_id ascending. Recency is
                    deliberately NOT used here, so the usage arm never sees a
                    ticket field and the arms stay independent. (Usage and
                    combined scores are continuous, so this clause never fires
                    at either published cut; it is stated so the rule holds if
                    the data ever changes.)

The recency tie-break stays inside the text layer: it uses only ticket dates, no
usage or answer-key information, so the text arm remains independent of the
usage arm. account_id ascending makes the order fully deterministic.

Accounts with no tickets would have no recency; they sort after dated accounts
at equal score (NaT last). All 500 accounts currently have tickets.
