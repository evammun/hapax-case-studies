"""
replace_a4_prose.py — Splices newly-written A4 low-volume ticket prose into
data/tickets_raw/, replacing the OLD high-volume A4 prose in place.

Design context: code/regenerate_a4_briefs.py rewrote data/ticket_briefs.json
with a new, low-volume brief set for A4 accounts (see that script's
docstring). code/make_a4_rewrite_batches.py then split those new briefs into
data/brief_batches_a4/batch_NN.json for a ticket-writer agent to turn into
prose. THIS script is the final step: once the agent has written that prose
into data/tickets_raw_a4/batch_NN.json (the same raw schema as any other
batch — account_id, ticket_index, date, module, resolved, resolution_days,
channel, subject, body), this script:

  1. Reads every data/tickets_raw_a4/batch_NN.json file (the new A4 prose).
  2. Validates the new prose's (account_id, ticket_index) keys against the
     CURRENT data/ticket_briefs.json A4 entries exactly — no missing, no
     extra, no duplicates. Refuses to touch anything if validation fails.
  3. For every A4 account, finds which data/tickets_raw/batch_NN.json file
     currently holds its OLD (high-volume) records, so the new records can
     be inserted into that SAME file, preserving each account's original
     batch placement.
  4. Rewrites each affected data/tickets_raw/batch_NN.json file: strips out
     every OLD record belonging to an A4 account and inserts the account's
     NEW records at the position the old block occupied (accounts stay
     grouped together). Non-A4 records in every batch file are left
     completely untouched (same objects, same order).
  5. Prints a before/after record-count summary (old A4 ~559 records once,
     ~191 now — the exact numbers are read from the data, not hardcoded).

This script is NOT run as part of the current redesign step — no A4 prose
exists yet in data/tickets_raw_a4/. It exists so the pipeline has a ready,
tested next step once the ticket-writer agent has produced that prose (it
was tested against a scratchpad fixture, never against data/tickets_raw/
directly — see the project's CLAUDE.md: never hand-edit or dry-run against
real project data folders when a scratch fixture will do).

Run from the project root, once data/tickets_raw_a4/ is populated:
