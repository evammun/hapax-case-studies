"""
build_features.py — Builds the snapshot feature table for the classical ML pipeline.

Design doc: Case Studies/01 Churn/design/design.md, section 5, step 2.

Snapshot design (the whole point of this script):
    For each account, the feature window ends TWO MONTHS BEFORE its churn month
    (churned accounts) or two months before its last observed month (retained
    accounts). This gives the model actionable lead time — it is never allowed
    to read usage data from the month immediately preceding churn (where the
    A4 "quietly unhappy" archetype's cliff drop lives) or any data after the
    snapshot date at all.

Feature families (per account, computed only from usage_monthly.csv rows with
month <= snapshot_end and tickets.csv rows with created_at <= snapshot_end):
    - Usage levels: last-3-month mean per metric
    - Usage trends: 3-month and 6-month fractional slopes per metric
    - Module mix shift: change in each module's share of total activity
      between the recent 3 months and the prior 3 months
    - Seat utilisation (active_users / licensed_seats): level and trend
    - Tenure, plan tier, ARR
    - Ticket metadata ONLY (counts, resolution days, resolved rate, csat) —
      NEVER subject/body text. That boundary belongs to the agent layer.

Run from the project root:
    python code/build_features.py

    Why this is necessary: the product has a real built-in "summer dip"
    seasonal pattern. Retained accounts in this dataset are ALWAYS snapshotted
    at the same fixed calendar window (Aug-Oct, two months before the
    observation window's end), while churned accounts are snapshotted at
    scattered calendar months tied to their individual churn dates. That
    means the seasonal cycle's phase at snapshot time is systematically
    different between survivors and churners as a GROUP, purely as a
    calendar artefact -- e.g. Aug-Oct sits on the recovering half of the
    cosine (post-July-trough), so every retained account's raw 3-month trend
    gets a deterministic upward nudge that has nothing to do with its actual
    behaviour. Deseasonalising before computing level/trend features removes
    this artefact the same way a competent analyst would deseasonalise

    Handles sparsity explicitly: csat is rarely filled in, so we report both

    Also reports LIFETIME (signup-to-snapshot) ticket metadata alongside the
    trailing-window figures, for transparency and comparison.

    Historical note: an earlier data-generation defect clustered most tickets
    for non-churning archetypes within roughly the first two months after
    signup, which made trailing-window ticket features a disguised churn
    proxy (a long-tenured survivor's trailing window saw almost no tickets
    purely because of when its tickets happened to have been generated, not
    because it was quiet) -- the *_lifetime columns were introduced as a
    workaround, immune to that clustering. The defect has since been fixed
    at source: ticket dates are now spread realistically across each
    account's life for every archetype. train_models.py verifies this
    empirically (trailing-window ticket counts by archetype no longer show
    mechanical churn/non-churn separation) before re-admitting the
    trailing-window features to the trained model. Both families are kept
    here so that check, and any future one, has something to check against.
