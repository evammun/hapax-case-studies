fix_a4_ticket_metadata.py — "Close-the-tickets" design fix for archetype A4.

Design context (see design/design.md section 3, and data/model/ml_report.md's
"A4 before -> after" section): A4 ("quietly unhappy") accounts are supposed to
be detectable ONLY from ticket prose, never from structured ticket metadata.
The v2 ML re-run (post ticket-date-fix, post csat-quieting) showed A4's
unresolved-ticket rate and slow resolution_days were still leaking the signal
to the classical model (A4 mean risk score 0.666, 67% of A4 accounts in the
top-100 — see ml_report.md "A4 is still not fully invisible to the classical
model").

Decision taken (Eva, 9 Jul 2026): A4 tickets get CLOSED by support
("resolved") even though the underlying fix does not hold — the notorious
real-world support pattern of "ticket marked resolved, problem persists."
Support closes A4 tickets promptly (resolution_days drawn 1-5, same as any
other quickly-handled ticket) but the account's dissatisfaction survives only
in later tickets' prose ("the fix from October did not hold, we've set up a
workaround" — prose already written, untouched by this script). This removes
the ticket OUTCOME leak (unresolved_count_6m, mean_resolution_days_6m)
without touching a single word of ticket text.

What this script does:
  1. Backs up the CURRENT data/ticket_briefs.json (the v2 post-date-fix state)
     to data/ticket_briefs_v2_a4unresolved.json, so the pre-fix state is
     recoverable. Skipped (with a warning) if that backup already exists —
     re-running this script must never overwrite the one true "before" snapshot
     with an already-fixed state.
  2. For every ticket brief belonging to an A4 account (per answer_key.csv)
     that was previously unresolved: sets resolved = True and draws
     resolution_days from a seeded uniform integer in [1, 5] (support closes
     promptly). Already-resolved A4 tickets are left completely alone —
     their existing resolution_days is untouched.
  3. Applies the EXACT SAME (account_id, ticket_index) -> resolution_days
     mapping to the matching records in data/tickets_raw/batch_*.json — only
     the resolved and resolution_days fields, never subject/body/channel/date.
     The mapping is computed once so the brief and the raw ticket always agree.
  4. Prints a before/after per-archetype unresolved-ticket table.

Never touches usage_monthly.csv, accounts.csv, answer_key.csv, or any ticket
prose. Must be followed by re-running assemble_tickets.py, build_features.py,
train_models.py, and make_assessment_batches.py (see project CLAUDE.md
pipeline order) to propagate the fix downstream.
