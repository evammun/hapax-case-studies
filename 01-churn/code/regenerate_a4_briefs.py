regenerate_a4_briefs.py — Redesigns A4 ("quietly unhappy") tickets as LOW-VOLUME.

Design context (see design/design.md section 3, config.A4_LOW_VOLUME_TICKET_PARAMS,
and data/model/ml_report.md's v1->v3 honesty trail): three generations of
metadata quieting (csat in v2, then resolved/resolution_days in v3 via
fix_a4_ticket_metadata.py) still failed to make A4 invisible to the classical
model. The reason, diagnosed in v3's SHAP breakdown: A4's TICKET VOLUME
itself, independent of sentiment or outcome, was the residual fingerprint
(mean ticket_count_6m 6.65 for A4 vs 1.04 for healthy A1 — see ml_report.md
"A4 before -> after"). Decision taken (Eva, 9 Jul 2026): A4 accounts now file
FEW tickets, like a healthy account in volume. Their disengagement shows as
going quiet, not as traffic — each of the small number of tickets they do
file is long, polite, and densely documented (a prose-layer instruction for
the ticket-writer agent, not something this script controls).

What this script does, for A4 accounts ONLY (identified via
data/answer_key.csv):
  1. Backs up the CURRENT data/ticket_briefs.json (the v3 "close-the-tickets"
     high-volume state) to data/ticket_briefs_v3_a4highvolume.json. Skipped,
     with a warning, if that backup already exists (re-running this script
     must never clobber the one true "before" snapshot with an
     already-regenerated state).
  2. For each A4 account, generates a fresh, LOW-VOLUME set of ticket briefs
     (config.A4_LOW_VOLUME_TICKET_PARAMS: Poisson(4.3) clipped to [3, 6]
     tickets total per account across its whole life), keeping the designed
     signal structure:
       - the frustration arc (neutral -> mild_frustration -> frustrated ->
         competitor_mention -> unresolved_complaint) is still present,
         compressed to fit the lower ticket count;
       - at least one competitor mention per account, reusing the SAME
         competitor the account mentioned in the old (high-volume) briefs
         wherever one existed there (persisted forward for narrative
         continuity — checked at run time, see step 4 below);
       - the metadata stays "closed" per the v3 close-the-tickets design:
         resolved = True, resolution_days drawn uniformly from [1, 5];
       - 1-2 consistent contact personas per account (drawn fresh, same
         persona pools as generate_ticket_briefs.py);
       - most of the account's tickets are dated in the trailing 6-month
         feature window (window ends config.A4_LOW_VOLUME_TICKET_PARAMS'
         snapshot_lead_months before churn, spans window_months backward
         from there -- this mirrors build_features.py's SNAPSHOT_LEAD_MONTHS
         / TREND_LONG_MONTHS exactly), with the remainder dated earlier in
         the account's life as the "early neutral" stage of the arc. This is
         deliberate: the goal is trailing-window ticket VOLUME that reads
         like a healthy account (A1/A8), not lifetime volume.
  3. Splices the new A4 brief blocks into data/ticket_briefs.json IN PLACE,
     at the position each account's old block occupied, leaving every other
     archetype's brief dicts untouched (same object references — verified
     byte-identical at the end of this script's run).
  4. Does NOT touch data/tickets_raw/ or data/tickets.csv — no ticket-writer
     prose exists yet for the new low-volume briefs. That is
     code/replace_a4_prose.py's job, run later once
     code/make_a4_rewrite_batches.py's batches have been written by the
     ticket-writer agent into data/tickets_raw_a4/.
  5. Also does NOT touch data/answer_key.csv: its planted_signals column for
     A4 is an archetype-level list of signal TYPE names ("competitor_mention;
     unresolved_complaint;frustration_escalation", identical for every A4
     account -- see generate_structured.py), not per-ticket references. All
     three signal types are still genuinely present in the low-volume
     design (guaranteed >=1 competitor mention, an unresolved-complaint
     stage, and a compressed-but-intact frustration arc), so the column
     remains truthful without modification.
