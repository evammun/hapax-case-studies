"""
train_models.py — Trains and evaluates the classical ML churn pipeline.

Design doc: Case Studies/01 Churn/design/design.md, section 5, step 2.

Pipeline:
    1. 70/30 account-level split, stratified by churn label, seed 42.
    2. Logistic regression (imputed + scaled features) as the honest baseline.
    3. Gradient boosting (LightGBM if installed, else HistGradientBoosting) as
       the production candidate.
    4. Report AUC, average precision, recall@top-50 on the held-out test set
       for both models.
    5. SHAP global importance + per-account SHAP values for the gradient
       boosting model, computed honestly out-of-fold via 5-fold stratified CV
       so every account's explanation comes from a model that never saw it.
    6. The same 5-fold CV produces ml_risk_score for all 500 accounts —
       nobody is scored by a model that trained on them.
    7. Evaluation against answer_key.csv (EVALUATION ONLY — the answer key
       never touches training). Per-archetype mean score and top-100 share,
       checked against the case study's designed expectations.

Run from the project root:
    python code/train_models.py

Outputs:
    data/model/ml_scores.csv       (account_id, ml_risk_score — all 500 accounts, out-of-fold)
    data/model/shap_values.csv     (account_id + per-feature SHAP values, out-of-fold)
    data/model/ml_report.md        (full metrics + per-archetype report)

# tenure_months is EXCLUDED from the trained feature set. Investigation (see
# ml_report.md, "Data artefact investigation" section) found it is a
# mechanical confound of this dataset's snapshot design, not genuine
# behavioural signal: churn_date is drawn uniformly between signup+6 months
# and the observation window's end (generate_structured.py), while retained
# accounts are always snapshotted at the same fixed calendar date. That
# structurally gives every churning archetype (including A5, "sudden death",
# which is designed to be undetectable) a much shorter tenure-at-snapshot
# than survivors -- regardless of any real behavioural difference. Feeding it
# to the model let it separate churners from survivors almost perfectly
# (AUC ~0.98) purely off remaining tenure, which would have wrecked the
# case study's central comparison (A4 must be invisible to ML, A5 must be
# undetectable). It is still computed and kept in features.csv for
# transparency; run_tenure_ablation() below quantifies the effect.
#
# POST-FIX (this run): the ticket-date clustering defect that used to make
# trailing-window ticket features (ticket_count_6m etc.) a disguised churn
# proxy has been fixed at source -- ticket dates are now spread realistically
# across every account's life, for every archetype. run_ticket_window_diagnostic()
# below re-checks this empirically (trailing-window ticket counts by
# archetype, checking specifically that non-churning archetypes are no
# longer mechanically separated from churners) before the trailing-window
# features are re-admitted to the trained model. The *_lifetime ticket
# features were only ever a workaround for that defect; now that the
# underlying window features are legitimate, the *_lifetime family is
# excluded instead (kept in features.csv for transparency, same treatment
# as tenure_months) to avoid feeding the model two redundant views of the
# same signal.
