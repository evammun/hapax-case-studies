# Data coherence validation report

Date: 11 September 2026
Dataset: v4 frozen dataset (the shipped, published dataset — see `design/DECISIONS.md`
for the A4 v1→v4 iteration trail that produced it)
Command: `python code/validate_data.py`

This report fulfils design.md §4's promise of a data-quality report, run against
the frozen v4 dataset before packaging. Note on reproduction: the command above
was run with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` set in the environment — the script's own
print statements emit an em-dash and a `≤` character that a plain Windows
console (cp1252 code page) cannot encode, which otherwise crashes the process
with a `UnicodeEncodeError` after the Rule 7 line. This is a console-encoding
artefact, not a data or logic defect: every rule check below completed and
passed. The script itself was not modified.

All eight coherence rules from design.md §4 pass. Full stdout follows verbatim.
