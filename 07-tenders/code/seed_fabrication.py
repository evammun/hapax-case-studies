"""Phase 2b seeded fabrication augmentation for Project 7 (Tenders).

CLOSES A DESIGN GAP found by grep after Phase 2 finished and BEFORE any
Arm A prose existed (design/DECISIONS.md records the gap and this fix).
design.md S7.4 pre-registers "fabricated claims present in >= 25% of Arm A
attempts", but the Phase 2 attempt briefs (`data/attempt_briefs/*.json`)
carried no fabrication signal at all -- grepping "fabricat" across every
attempt brief returned nothing. Left as-is, that would hand fabrication to
the Phase 3 prose agent's improvisation, which violates the house pattern
used everywhere else in this portfolio: deterministic Python decides
STRUCTURE and outcomes; LLM agents only dramatise prose consistent with a
brief they may not deviate from. `build_attempt_brief()` in
`generate_structure.py` already does this for requirement engagement
(engaged/skimmed); this script does the equivalent for fabrication and
augments the same attempt-brief files in place.

THE MECHANISM (the realistic one, not "the persona lies"): a chatbot
plausibly drafts an overclaim when asked to summarise Visakoivu's
eligibility, track record, capacity, or capability, and a persona who does
not cross-check the draft against the facts library pastes it in unverified.
Fabrication enters via unverified assistant output, not deliberate lying --
consistent with design.md S10 Q1's "habits, never mockery" register.

Two fields are added to each of the 64 attempt briefs, IN PLACE, preserving
every existing field:

  checks_facts_library : bool
      Whether this persona, on this attempt, cross-checks claims against
      the facts library before submitting. Driven by the persona's
      `eligibility_scrutiny` and `time_pressure_decay` traits (already in
      config.py -- eligibility_scrutiny is literally described there as
      "checking a certification or reference threshold against the facts
      library", the exact cross-reference step this field measures), via
      one seeded coin-flip per attempt. No persona-specific hardcoding.

  fabrication_events : list[dict]
      Empty when `checks_facts_library` is true. Otherwise, a further
      seeded coin-flip decides whether this attempt's draft carries exactly
      one concrete overclaim (kept to one per attempt for markability),
      chosen from four checkable mechanisms: invented_certification,
      inflated_reference, capacity_overclaim, uncited_capability. Every
      event carries `claimed_value`/`true_value` fields alongside its prose
      `instruction`, so `code/mark.py` (Phase 5) can check it mechanically
      against `company_facts.yaml` without parsing prose.

Fresh RNG stream: this script derives its draws from `config.RANDOM_SEED`
(7, unchanged) plus a distinct `FABRICATION_SALT`, folded in before any
tender/persona index -- so this script's coin-flips are statistically
independent of `generate_structure.py`'s engagement-model draws even though
both start from the same global seed, and re-running this script alone is
byte-for-byte deterministic.

This is a deliberate IN-PLACE augmentation of Phase 2 generated artifacts
(not source prose, not tender documents, not the answer key, not clause
maps) -- analogous in kind to the churn project's one-off repair tools, but
run BEFORE any Phase 3 Arm A prose exists, so pre-registration is intact:
nothing about what Phase 3 will write has been observed yet.

Run: python seed_fabrication.py         (after generate_structure.py)
Then: python validate_structure.py      (now also checks these two fields)
