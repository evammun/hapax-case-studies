"""Dry test for the Arm B gates (Project 7, Phase 4 build step).

Proves gates.py actually catches what design.md S5 requires it to catch,
against a tiny synthetic fixture (code/arm_b/fixtures/) that is NOT part of
the Project 7 corpus -- a throwaway 3-requirement mini-tender and mini
facts library, structurally identical in shape to the real
company_facts.yaml so the real resolver/parsing code is exercised end to
end, not a mocked-out shortcut.

Five outcomes are asserted, one per fixture run directory under
code/arm_b/fixtures/runs/:
  - unanswered_row          -> coverage gate fails (UNANSWERED_ROW)
  - uncited_claim           -> facts gate fails (FABRICATION, eur_amount)
  - fabricated_cert         -> facts gate fails (FABRICATION, certification
                                 held=false -- proves the gate checks the
                                 held flag, not just substring containment)
  - cross_row_inconsistency -> consistency gate fails (CROSS_ROW_INCONSISTENCY)
                                 (this fixture ALSO trips the facts gate,
                                 since at most one of the two conflicting
                                 claims can be true against the single real
                                 fact -- documented, not a test bug: a false
                                 claim about a shared fact is simultaneously
                                 a fabrication AND inconsistent with its
                                 sibling row, and a correct implementation
                                 should flag both)
  - clean_pass              -> all three gates pass, zero bounces

A handful of resolve_fact_path() unit checks are included directly (the
top-level "references" alias, case-insensitive list-item matching) since
those are load-bearing for the facts gate and easy to silently break.

Run: python test_gates.py
Exits 0 if every assertion passes, 1 otherwise (house convention, matching
validate_structure.py elsewhere in this project).
