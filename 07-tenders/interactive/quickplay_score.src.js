/* quickplay_score.src.js -- the "Play a Tender Yourself" marking core.
 *
 * This is the ONE source of truth for how the game scores a visitor's play.
 * It is inlined verbatim into tender-workflow.html by build_data.py (between
 * markers, see that script), and it is ALSO loaded directly, unmodified, by
 * code/verify_interactive_07.py, which runs it under Node against the real
 * per-requirement "addressed" flags and bid decisions that code/mark.py
 * already computed for the twelve real Arm A attempts on T04/T08/T11 -- the
 * spot-check design.md S8 requires ("a JS port of mark.py's coverage
 * scoring, spot-checked against it"). Editing the scoring logic in the built
 * HTML without editing this file (or vice versa) will make that check fail
 * on the next QA run, by design.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PORT, NOT A CLONE, OF mark.py: the game's interaction is
 * clause-ticking (does the visitor recognise a numbered clause as a live
 * requirement?) plus one bid/no-bid call, not a drafted document -- mark.py
 * scores free text. Three things port EXACTLY, because they do not depend on
 * drafted prose in mark.py's own logic either:
 *
 *   1. Coverage % -- mark.py: matched_requirements / total_requirements.
 *      Here: matched = number of the tender's key requirements whose own
 *      clause was ticked, over the same total. Identical arithmetic given
 *      identical "addressed" inputs -- verified by the QA spot-check below.
 *   2. The eligibility_fail trap (T11-R005) -- mark.py's assess_traps()
 *      defines "caught" as bid_decision == "no-bid" OR explicit conflict-
 *      language in the drafted text; ticking the clause plays no part in
 *      mark.py's own catch condition either. Here: caught = the visitor's
 *      call is "no-bid". Exact port.
 *   3. The contradiction trap (T08-R014 / T08-R029) -- mark.py's caught
 *      requires BOTH paired requirements addressed AND explicit conflict-
 *      flagging language found in the draft. The game cannot produce
 *      drafted prose, so it asks the visitor directly, once both members of
 *      the pair are ticked: "flag the conflict?" caught = both ticked AND
 *      the visitor flagged it. Exact port of the same two-part condition,
 *      with the flag question standing in for conflict language mark.py
 *      would otherwise search for.
 *
 * The format_trap (T04-R013) is scored as caught = ticked. In mark.py this
 * trap's own check (check_format_trap) is a compliance check on the drafted
 * text, not a bare "addressed" flag -- but for this specific trap "addressed"
 * and "compliant" have been the same value on every one of the four real T04
 * Arm A attempts (see the QA script's fixture), because the requirement IS
 * "state the 11pt minimum", so noticing it and stating it are the same
 * chatbot output. That equivalence is empirical, reported as such, and
 * spot-checked below -- not assumed.
