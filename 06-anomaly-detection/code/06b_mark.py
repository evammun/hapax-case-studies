06b_mark.py -- marks the vendor-drift review's output against the 06b answer
key and the six pre-registered expectations (design doc section 5).

THE ONLY FILE IN 06b THAT OPENS data/06b/answer_key_06b.csv. drift_report.py
never does (grep-verified, see its own docstring); this script is the one
place ground truth and the mechanical output meet.

Design doc: Case Studies/06 Anomaly Detection/design/design-06b-drift-report.md
section 5's six expectations, written BEFORE any 06b code ran, are checked
here one by one. Per the design's own pre-commitment (carried from 06a):
any expectation that fails is FROZEN and reported verbatim -- this script
never adjusts drift_report.py's parameters or 06b_generate.py's plant
magnitudes to make an expectation pass after the fact. It only reports what
the two upstream, parameter-fixed runs (data/06b/drift_report.md for the
FY2026 ledger, data/06b/drift_report_2025_retro.md for 6a's frozen 2025
ledger) actually found.

Writes data/06b/report.md.
